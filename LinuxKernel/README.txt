Additions to the linux kernel that allow message passing from one process to another using Kernel space memory. In general, every subdirectory of interest has its own README.

"Linux" subdirectory
-----------------------------
contains the entire uncompiled Linux OS with some custom additions.

"Additions to the Kernel" subdirectory
-----------------------------
contains the code that I wrote and added to allow basic message passing
with my own mailbox structure. Also contains drivers, test files, and other things of note.
