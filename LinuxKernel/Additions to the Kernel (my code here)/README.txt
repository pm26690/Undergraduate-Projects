All other READMEs below this one were originally submitted with the project and may contain
outdated information or notes to the grader.

"mailbox" subdirectory
-------------------------------------
contains the implementation of the system calls defined in syscalls.h (which also contains
all system calls for this version of Linux) made possible by editing the system call table
and making some other simple changes to the Kernel.

"proj1tests" subdirectory
-------------------------------------
contains the test drivers for mailbox that work on my compiled custom Linux kernel, also contains
interesting source code for things I built in userspace before porting them to the kernel.
