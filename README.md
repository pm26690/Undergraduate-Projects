# Undergraduate-Projects
Interesting undergraduate projects (some collaborative) started or completed during my studies at UMBC in reverse 
chronological order.

# TCP and UDP
Simple Tic-Tac-Toe game designed to be played with a linux shell between one server and client in either UDP or TCP 
respectively. All work done by myself in python using a text editor, testing done on Debian Linux on my VM.

# ConnectFour
Connect Four game designed to be played in a linux shell between a player and an AI programmed by myself
with inspiration from a minimax implementation of a Connect Four AI done by Lukas Vermeer. Was originally a
collaborative project, this portion of the project is everything completed soley by myself in Java using
Eclipse IDE.

# LinuxKernel
Mostly cryptic Linux kernel code, contains additions to the system calls for an older version of Linux that
allows custom message passing, does not block and lock correctly, but still completed to satisfaction. All work
done by myself in a text editor on Debian Linux on my VM.

# LinuxCustomFilesystem
Custom filesystem made for Linux using Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) as oppossed to editing the Kernel. Based off of
an archaic filesystem structure for the SEGA dreamcast (or something similar). Currently only supports reading
filesystem images, not writing or deleting. All work done by myself in a text editor on Debian Linux on my VM.
