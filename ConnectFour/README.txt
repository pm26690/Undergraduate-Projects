My personal portion of a collaborative work done for an Artificial Intelligence course at UMBC. This
is designed to be ran in a Linux shell on a system with the latest version of the JRE and JDK. One
method Takes functional inspiration from a similar work by Lukas Vermeer, a link to his github is in my code.

Has no dependencies, simply compile with "javac ConnectFour.java" and run with "java ConnectFour.java"

Has instruction prompts, regular mode allows you to play Connect Four in several different described
configurations. Testing mode was used to benchmark the AI (as it is hardware intensive) on several
different machines.
